Do you remember the first time you used a chat tool at work?

I vividly recall the impact it had on our nascent, mostly-distributed startup crew. I suddenly felt connected to my remote colleagues as if we were in the same building.

“Now we’re cooking with gas,” I thought.

Anytime I had to ask my co-founder a question, he was just a quick DM or @-mention away — the digital analog to a tap on the shoulder. This proved to be much faster than firing off an email and waiting for a reply.

I realize this is not news to you now, but four years ago it was ground-breaking.

Slack felt like the much needed grease in the gears of our budding startup. It brought visibility to conversations that would have otherwise been trapped in an email silo. It lowered the barrier of formality that plagues email correspondence. It increased the velocity of communication.

Simply put, it ended the need to wait.

In the beginning, this seemed like an indelible leap ahead. Fast forward four years, and I'm convinced it is the single greatest threat to productivity in the modern workplace.

The problem is that today's tools are amplifying the troublesome parts of human nature, rather than minimizing them.

We are impatient.

We have anxiety for "unread" badges.

We are addicted to push notifications.

We think things are more urgent than they really are.

We care about our team’s perceptions and don't want to look like we’re slacking off.

Chat is not intrinsically bad. It’s part of what made Slack feel so magical in the beginning, and it’s a key ingredient in tools of the future. The ability to the engage with your team in real time is vital — but only when the discussion needs to be synchronous.

Today's tools create an expectation of availability. "Do Not Disturb" does little to solve the problem. When you choose to snooze, important conversations quickly become buried among the din of unimportant chatter. Good luck keeping track of those.

This pain is felt much more deeply by makers than managers. The manager’s job is to be available for interruptions by their team. An effective manager is one who provides servant leadership and strives to keep their team unblocked. And managers are often tasked with choosing the tools we use.

Even the most respectful manager will inevitably interfere with maker time because today’s tools do nothing to prevent it — in fact, they encourage it.

As makers:

- We know that most discussions are not so urgent they warrant breaking flow
- We know the painful cost of context switching
- We’d much rather be “addicted” to our craft than our chat tool
- We believe that unmitigated access to our push notifications is damn near criminal

It's about time our tools complemented the way we work.
