Do you remember the first time you used a chat tool for work?

I vividly recall that it had a profound impact on our nascent team of mostly-remote folks. I felt amazingly connected to my colleagues like never before.

It was almost as if we were all in the same physical space. Anytime I had to ask Ian a question, he was just a quick DM or @-mention away — the digital analog to a tap on the shoulder. This proved to be much faster than firing off an email and waiting for a reply.

Slack felt like the much needed grease in the gears of our budding startup. It brought visibility to conversations that would have otherwise been trapped in an email silo. It lowered the barrier of formality that plagues email correspondence. It increased the velocity of communication.

Simply put, it ended the need to _wait_.

In the beginning, this seemed like an incredible leap ahead in progress. Fast forward four years, I'm convinced this is the single greatest threat to productivity in the modern workplace.

**The problem is that today's tools are amplifying the troublesome parts of human nature, rather than minimizing them.**

- We are impatient.
- We have anxiety for "unread" badges.
- We are addicted to push notifications.
- We tend to think things are more urgent than they really are.
- We care about perceptions and don't want to look like we are slacking off.

"Do Not Disturb" mode does little to solve the actual problem. Today's tools establish an expectation of availability. When you choose to snooze, important conversations are likely to occur and become buried amongst many unimportant ones in fast-flowing river of messages in the timeline. Good luck keeping track of those.

This pain is felt much more deeply by makers than “managers.” The manager’s job is to be available for interruptions by their team. An effective manager is one who provides servant leadership and strives to keep their team unblocked. And managers are often tasked with choosing the tools we use.

Even the most respectful manager will inevitably interfere with maker time because today’s tools do nothing to prevent it — in fact, they encourage it.

As makers,

- We know that most discussions do not warrant breaking flow.
- We know the painful cost of context switching.
- We’d much rather be “addicted” to our craft than our chat tool.
- We believe that unmitigated access to our push notifications is damn near criminal.

## It's about time that our tools complement the way we work, rather than fight against it.

If you agree, join me on the mission to squash this infection in the modern workplace.
