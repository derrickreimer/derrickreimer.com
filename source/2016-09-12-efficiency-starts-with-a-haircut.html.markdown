Derrick switches domains from getdrip.com to [drip.co](https://www.drip.co), begins to update the design of the Drip widget, and tries to find balance in his varying roles as CTO. Ben hands off the reins of Upcase, switches to a low-tech project management solution, and mixes work and personal todos.
