I joined the Ruby Rogues panel to discuss my experience building and scaling [Drip](https://www.drip.co) and [Codetree](https://codetree.com), two software-as-a-service applications built in Ruby + Rails. We talked about choosing technologies, challenges with growing infrastructure, and how to we have dealt with constraints as a self-funded business.
